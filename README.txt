This is my attempt at recreating the popular video game Snake using C++ and SDL. 

The goal of the game is to collect points with your snake. Each time you collect a point, the snake increases 
in length. While doing all of this, you need to avoid colliding into yourself (the snake) and the edges of the 
screen. 

- To play the game, go to the "Game" folder and click "Snake.exe"
- To view the code, go to the "Snake" folder
